# TicTacToe

BIG changes this time. I completed the game, fully adding every program needed to play tic-tac-toe. I added a function to check for a tie, to check for a win on either side, to reset the board. I also added a way to count the number of wins each side has, as well as choose whether you want to play again or quit
